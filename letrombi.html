                      <p>Florian: aka Flauz the butcher. Flauz came from America to this dark place because he wanted to test the next level of mind challenge. Flauz thought that after all his adventures in the rough territories of his land nothing would beat him. What he didn't expect, like many others, is that he would become a part of this mad building. The rest of this paragraph is just here to fill the box that we will ajust later, probably with flexbox.</p>

                        <p>LÃ©onard: aka Leo the Bug. Leo is one of the main challengers of the school. We won't tell his full name because he is famous for escaping the most secure prisons of Europe and now he is on the wanted list of Interpol. He looks tough but this might change in a few weeks as a Wilder. Maybe the secret services won't have to worry about him for a long time. We wish him good luck and may the odds be ever in his favor.</p>

                        <p>Fanny: aka Fyn a Vibora .Fyn lived in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro to stay hidden from the authorities. As a child she already broke the security systems of many governments to acces their secret databases. Now she is a famous cyber activist and she came to the School to stay under the radar. She may feel in her element there but she may not be aware of what this place implies.</p>

                        <p>Morgan: aka Margo Laquoi. Don't be fooled by this ever smiling face. He is the son of the greatest godfather in Sicilia. He has always been safe thanks to his father and the worst crimes he was responsible for where nothing to him. After some time he began to feel a lack of adrenaline and decided to go the outer world and survive on his own. His then heard of a filthy place where he would be able to test his willpower. Does he have what it takes ? Maybe, maybe not.</p>

                        <p>Maxence: aka Max Horn. After 12 years spent in the Rainforest In Bengladesh, Max thought he survived to the most dangerous environment in the world. He fought crocodiles barehanded, ate snakes for breakfast, resisted diseases, and felt the worst weather you could never imagine. He only had his ... and his knife with him and those were all he ever needed. Now he found another challenge that were he will meet the best and the worst of this world. Happy Wild games!</p>

                        <p>Carlotte: aka Crazy Charli or CC. CC is the creation of the Arkham Sanitarium - Massachusetts. It's a psychatric hospital where they treated patients in some unusual ways. Some people heard that the experiments were related to merfolks and the cult of an old divinity living under the sea. We don't really know what happened to CC during those dark days but maybe she is the most fitted person for our strange school. Approach with caution! We warned you.</p>
