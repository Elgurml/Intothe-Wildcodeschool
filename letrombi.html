                        <p>Leo is one of the main challengers of the school. We won't tell his full name because he is famous for escaping the most secure prisons of Europe and now he is on the wanted list of Interpol. He looks tough but this might change in a few weeks as a Wilder. Maybe the secret services won't have to worry about him for a long time. We wish him good luck and may the odds be ever in his favor.</p>

She may feel in her element there but she may not be aware of what this place implies.</p>

Does he have what it takes ? Maybe, maybe not.</p>
