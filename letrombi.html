                      <p class="titleBrown">Flauz came from America to this dark place because he wanted to test the next level of mind challenge. Flauz thought that after all his adventures in the rough territories of his land nothing would beat him. What he didn't expect, like many others, is that he would become a part of this mad building.</p>

                        <p>Leo is one of the main challengers of the school. We won't tell his full name because he is famous for escaping the most secure prisons of Europe and now he is on the wanted list of Interpol. He looks tough but this might change in a few weeks as a Wilder. Maybe the secret services won't have to worry about him for a long time. We wish him good luck and may the odds be ever in his favor.</p>
